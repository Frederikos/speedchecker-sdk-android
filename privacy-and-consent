## Privacy policy changes

Please add following paragraph to your privacy policy

#### Collected Location Data

This section describes how our app determines your location and explains that it cannot be used to personally identify you.

We may collect approximate location information that is provided or generated in any of the following ways:

- GPS coordinates
- Using the MAC address of wireless routers (an alphanumeric code that is unique to that hardware device)
- Using the Received Signal Strength Indicator (a measurement of the strength of the access point&#39;s signal at the time it is received by the mobile device) to identify the cell ID of nearby cell towers

This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify the user. We do not send or store any user/device IDs that could allow tracking location over a period of time. The location data along with network measurements may be shared with third parties to compile aggregate information about network statistics and bandwidth usage in particular areas but does not allow 3rd parties to track your location or movement over a period of time.
