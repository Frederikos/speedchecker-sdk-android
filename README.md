## FAQ

**Is the SDK free to use?**

Yes! But the SDK collects data on network performance from your app and shares it with Speedchecker and our clients. Free SDK version requires enabled location. Those restrictions are not in Basic and Advanced versions

**Do you have iOS SDK?**

Yes! Please take a look at this [repo](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-ios)

**Do you provide free support?**

No, we provide support only on Basic and Advanced plans

**What are all the metrics or KPIs that you can get using our SDKs?**

Free version of the SDK allows to get basic metrics which are described in this [API documentation](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-android/wiki/API-documentation)

[Full list of our KPIs of Basic and Advanced versions](https://www.speedchecker.com/broadband-data/kpis.html)

**Do you host all infrastructure for the test?**

Yes, you do not need to run any servers. We provide and maintain network of high-quality servers and CDNs to ensure the testing is accurate. If you wish to configure your own server, this is possible on Basic and Advanced plans.

**How do you measure the speed?**

See our [measurement methodology](https://www.speedchecker.com/broadband-data/measurement-method.html)
