## Requirements
 - minSdkVersion 16
 - Location permissions

## Installation
**1. Update the "project level" gradle file.**
<pre>
allprojects {
   repositories {
       maven {
            url 'https://maven.speedcheckerapi.com/artifactory/libs-demo'
            credentials {
                username = "demo"
                password = "AP85qiz6wYEsCttWU2ZckEWSwJKuA6mSYcizEY"
            }
       }
   }
}
</pre>
**2. Update the "app level" gradle file.**
<pre>
implementation 'com.speedchecker:android-sdk:4.2.105-3-demo'
</pre>
**3. Initialize SpeedcheckerSDK inside a main activity.**
<pre>
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();
  SpeedcheckerSDK.init(this);
}
</pre>
**4. Ask Location permissions.**
<pre>
SpeedcheckerSDK.askPermissions(this);
</pre>
**5. Implement the "SpeedTestListener" interface and override methods (an example below shows a new class with overriding methods but you could implement the interface at "MainActivity" or somewhere else).**
<pre>
import com.speedchecker.android.sdk.Public.SpeedTestListener;

public class SpeedTestCallbacks implements SpeedTestListener {
   @Override
   public void onTestStarted() {
         //your code here
   }
   @Override
   public void onFetchServerFailed() {
         //your code here
   }
   //â€¦ other methods here
}
</pre>
**6. Set implemented interface.**
<pre>
SpeedcheckerSDK.SpeedTest.setOnSpeedTestListener(new SpeedTestCallbacks());
OR 
SpeedcheckerSDK.SpeedTest.setOnSpeedTestListener(this);
</pre>
**7. Start Speed test.**
<pre>
SpeedcheckerSDK.SpeedTest.startTest(this);
</pre>
**8. That's it! To get more information you can take a look at our ["Demo" app](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-android/tree/master).**

## FAQ

**Is the SDK free to use?**

Yes! But the SDK collects data on network performance from your app and shares it with Speedchecker and our clients. Free SDK version requires enabled location. Those restrictions are not in Basic and Advanced versions

**Do you have iOS SDK?**

Yes! Please take a look at this [repo](https://github.com/speedchecker/speedchecker-sdk-ios)

**Do you provide free support?**

No, we provide support only on Basic and Advanced plans

**What are all the metrics or KPIs that you can get using our SDKs?**

[Full list of our KPIs](https://www.speedchecker.com/broadband-data/kpis.html)

**Do you host all infrastructure for the test?**

Yes, you do not need to run any servers. We provide and maintain network of high quality servers and CDNs to ensure the testing is accurate. If you wish to configure your own server, this is possible on Basic and Advanced plans.

**How do you measure the speed?**

See our [measurement methodology](https://www.speedchecker.com/broadband-data/measurement-method.html)
